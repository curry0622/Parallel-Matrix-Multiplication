# Test Case Format

## Input

In the first line, three integers **𝑚**, **𝑛** and **𝑙** are given separated by space characters.

In the following lines, the **𝑚×𝑛** matrix **𝐴** and the **𝑛×𝑙** matrix **𝐵** are given. All the numbers are integers.

## Output

Print elements of the **𝑚×𝑙** matrix **𝐶 (𝑐𝑖𝑗)**. Print a single space character after “each” element!

## Constraints

1. 1 ≤ 𝑚, 𝑛, 𝑙 ≤ 5000
2. 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖𝑗, 𝑏𝑖𝑗 ≤ 100
